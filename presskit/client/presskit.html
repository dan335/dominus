				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					Dominus is a multiplayer browser strategy game.  Players grow in power by attacking another player's castle.  Conquering someone's castle makes them your vassal.  Vassals send their lord part of their income.  If everyone in the game is your vassal or a vassal of your vassal then you are the Dominus.<br>
