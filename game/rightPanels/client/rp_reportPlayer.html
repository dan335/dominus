                Report people for spamming, being overly abusive towards others or soliciting.

                <br><br>

                Do not report people because they attacked you or destroyed your villages.

                <textarea class="form-control" rows="6" id="reasonText" placeholder="Why are you reporting this player?"></textarea>
                <br>

                <button class="btn btn-block btn-primary" id="reportPlayerButton">Report Player</button>
                <button class="btn btn-block btn-primary" id="cancelButton">Cancel</button>

                <br><br>

                When someone is reported they can't post in forums or chatrooms for a while.  The more people who report them the longer they are unable to post.  Who reported them and the reason why can be seen by everyone in the global alerts.
